  <h1><strong><u>THE MESSAGE</u></strong></h1>
  <p>  He came to earth for you and I,<br>
  He appeared to us as a human kind.<br>
 “Who is this, that even the wind obeys him?”,<br>
 Who is this, that all authority in Heaven above and on earth below belongs to him?<br>
Who is this that all creation bows at the mention of his name?<br>
His name is Jesus. He who was without sin but became sin for you and I.<br>
He died on the cross and rose again so we could be saved.<br>
Saved from what? From eternal damnation, from sin and all it craved.<br>
This is the message, this is the Gospel- the message of truth that the world needs to hear.<br>
If only you would believe and confess that Jesus is Lord,<br>
That he died and rose again for your salvation, that he is your redeemer and saviour, <br>
Then he will be yours today. He will embrace you as one of his own,<br>
Just accept him today, accept this message and live as one for whose sins have been atoned.<br>
Jesus loves you, he is waiting for you with opened arms. Do not resist him when you see or hear THE MESSAGE.<br>
<p><strong>TOMORROW MAY BE TOO LATE.</strong> </p>
